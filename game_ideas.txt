idea 1 (FFA):
Multiplayer flappy bird, with some dramatic effects.
You get to watch other players jump around and crash.
Whoever goes the longest wins.
Each person earns the number of jumps they made, winner gets a large bonus.

idea 2 (FFA):
Everyone is in a square arena, and every 30 seconds a ball-type object is shot in. It ricochets around the arena,
and if it collides with a players, the player is out. Last players standing wins. The number of objects will increase.
They will also have their ricochet angle adjusted by a slight but random amount on each bounce.
Winner wins a large amount, losers get however long they lasted.

idea 3 (2 Teams):
From super mario party, rowboat uprising. Each person paddles one side of a boat, and two boats race to the end.
There are obstacles in the way. Loser gets nothing

idea 4 (1 v Everyone else):
One person has no player character, but can send projectiles into the arena
where everyone is, or can break the tiles the players are standing on.
Basically one player controls a death room and has a set timer to try and
kill everyone. If he succeeds, he wins a massive amount, other players get
nothing. If he fails, he gets nothing and everyone else gets a large amount.

Board state:
Each member rolls a dice to progress certain amount of steps.
From each game, you gain a certain amount of points (coins).
There will be a shop available at all times, you can buy a
dice boost with coins, set back another player, get a
new dice, etc. At the end, there will be a star, which supercedes
coins in determining the winner.
You can buy a star for a considerable amount of coins.

Players can play alone or on teams.
Minigames are often 2v2, 1v3, or have more people,
meaning players will team occassionally.
The winners reap the benefits.


Tile types will include:
(G) GAME (Either preset or dice roll which game).
(+) Gain coins
(-) lose coins
(T) Trap - sends you back x spaces.
(E) - Empty, nothing happens.
(R) - Random, any of the above except empty
        Small chance the map is reshaped.
(S) - Final tile, grants a star and send you back to start
W-- - Warp tile, teleports player to corresponding tile (i.e. W1+ goes to W1-)



The layout is constant, but tiles will be randomly decided
at the start of every game.

Layout sketch

(.) is just a placeholder.

       (S) <- (.) <- (.) <- (.) 
                             |
(G) -> (.) -> (.) -> (.) -> (.) <- (.) <- (.) <- (.) <- (W1-) 
 |                                                |
(E) <- (+) <- (E) <- (G) -> (.) -> (.) -> (.) -> (.)
                      |
(E) -> (+) -> (-) -> (E) -> (G) -> (G) -> (T) -> (-) -> (R) -> ()
Start                 |
                     (E) -> (-) -> (G) -> (+) -> (R) -> (W1+)
